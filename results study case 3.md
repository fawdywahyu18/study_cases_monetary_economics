Reason for poin b answer:
Source from the official website of Fed: https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/what-happened-in-money-markets-in-september-2019-20200227.html
What happened in September 2019 was a surprising spike in short-term interest rates in the repo market, which is where banks borrow and lend reserves. This spike went above the Fed's target. The reason for this wasn't the Fed missing its target, but a temporary shortage of cash in the financial system. Two main factors are believed to have contributed:

1. Large tax payments: September 16th was a deadline for quarterly corporate tax payments, which pulled a significant amount of cash out of the system.
2. Treasury issuance: The government issuing new Treasury securities on the same day further drained available reserves.

This sudden decrease in reserves caused a scramble for cash among banks, driving up the repo rate above the Fed's target. Economists also point to a possibly low level of reserves in the system at the time, which may have amplified the issue.

Answers Number 2 poin c:
1. What was the average daily miss between the beginning of 2006 and the end of 2007? = 0.051 %
2. What was the average daily miss between the beginning of 2008 and December 15, 2008? = 0.224 %
3. What was the average daily miss for the period from December 16, 2008, to the most current date available? = 0.063 % Since 2006, what was the largest single daily miss? = 1.33 %

4. The comments on Fed's ability in controlling the fed funds rate:
2006-2007 (average daily miss of 0.051%): This period indicates a high level of control by the Fed. The very small daily miss suggests the Fed was effectively influencing the rate banks charged each other for overnight loans (the federal funds rate) and keeping it close to the target set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

2008 (average daily miss of 0.224%): This period shows a decline in the Fed's control. The daily miss is over four times higher compared to the previous period. This suggests the financial crisis of 2008 disrupted the normal functioning of the money market, making it harder for the Fed to influence the federal funds rate as effectively. Banks might have been more reluctant to lend or borrow freely due to the uncertainty and risk in the market.

2008 (December 16th onwards) - Present (average daily miss of 0.063%): This period shows a recovery in the Fed's control. The daily miss is lower than 2008 overall and closer to the levels seen in 2006-2007. This suggests the Fed's unconventional monetary policy, such as quantitative easing, helped restore stability to the money market, allowing them to influence the federal funds rate more effectively again.
